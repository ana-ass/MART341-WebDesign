1. I did not have the ability to participate in the peer review for this week.  I am catching up on posting at least once to each discussion post after I finish all of my coding assignments.

2. The page I am working on this week is **journal.html**.

3. I used class selectors the most since they were easiest to call back to and what I was used to formatting from previous assignments.  I found class selectors easiest to use when being applied to text styling rather than a large area like the heading or footer as a whole.

I used an ID selector for the top of my webpage (Journaltop).  This area will remain unchanged outside of addition to journal post links, and therefore needed a divid for internal links.

4. The three techniques I chose were:

**Different background colors** for the Journaltop with a lowered **opacity** to distinguish it from the header and the journal post itself.  I tried to keep most of my colors the same, and focused on the opacity but some values did have to be a darker hue.  I also repeated this technique for the footer, to also separate it from the rest of the web page.

I also used **borders** and **outlines** to give the webpage a cleaner look.  I applied borders to the images, so they looked frame and looked more organized on the webpage.  I also applied an outline to the webpage, framing the entire page in a darker color that matched the heading.  This allowed for the removal of odd margins that made the page look disjointed and messy.
