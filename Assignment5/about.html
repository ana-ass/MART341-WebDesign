<h1>Why I Chose These Websites</h1>

<h3>Portfolio</h3>
<p>I would like to make a portfolio because I am an artist and creator.  Creating my own website to host my work that I can personally edit and draft makes the possibilites endless.  It is another way for me to create, instead of having to rely on others to do it for me or host on services I would need to pay for.</p>

<h3>Fourm Site</h3>
<p>As someone who has been in media based spaces for years, forums hold a special place in my heart.  Forums have died out with the rise of social media, and I would like to bring them back for my interest.  Many people I have talked to share the sentiment of missing forums, and I would like to use my skills to provide this.</p>

<h3>Journal Site</h3>
<p>Since the start of 2020 I have struggled with chronic illnesses and the continuing worsening of symptoms.  During this time I felt very alone as a young person who could not explain why they were not healthy.  Due to being in very small towns for a long time, this isolation and lonely feeling got worse overtime.  I have struggled greatly this semester with continuing worsening symptoms, and would like to host a journal site so others struggling wouldn't feel alone like I did.  Even if it is hosted only in the state of Montana or other small towns such as in Wyoming, I would like to give a personal helping hand to fellow young people who feel unseen.</p>
