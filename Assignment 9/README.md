# How to Make Rice and Steamed Eggs

## Materials You Will Need:

- White Rice (this recipe uses Jasmine)
- Rice Cooker/Pot to Cook Rice
- Olive Oil (any cooking oil can work/butter)
- Pan with Lid
- Water
- Eggs
- Soy Sauce
- Toasted Sesame Oil
- Salt
- Pepper
- Further Seasoning (optional)

## Recipe Instructions:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Rice
First, pour out one cup of rice into a bowl or your rice cooker.  Wash the rice by stirring your hand in the grains and drain.  Repeat process until water is not milky.

### Step 2: Cook Your Rice
Allow your rice to cook, if it is in a rice cooker it will take around 15-20 minutes.  Once the rice is done, let it sit with the lid on and let it continue to stay warm in the pot.

### Step 3: Start the Eggs
Take out a pan that has a lid which can fit.  Set the heat to medium and oil lightly.

### Step 4: Cook the Eggs
Once the pan is up to the proper heat, crack **two** eggs into the pan.  Keep the yolks intact, do not let them break.  Season with salt, pepper, or seasonings of choice.

### Step 5: Steam the Eggs
Once the whites of the eggs have started to solidify, add a small amount of water into the pan.  Cover with the lid immediately to start steam cooking the eggs.  

### Step 6: Plate your Rice
Place your rice into a bowl or onto a plate and flatten, season if you would like at this step.

### Step 7: Remove the Eggs
After cooking until the egg is steamed, and the yolk has ample movement (around 2-3 minutes) remove the lid and take the pan off the heat.  Using a spatula take the eggs out of the pan, and place them onto the rice.

### Step 8: Dress the Dish
Take soy sauce and add to your own personal taste.  I personally use a lot due to the need of high sodium, but this recipe will not change based on the amount.  Once it is applied to your liking, add toasted sesame oil to your own preference.  

### Step 9: Stir
Using Chopsticks or a Fork, depending on your choice stir your dish.  Use long strokes in order to properly break up the eggs and allow the yolk to bind the rice together.  Add soy sauce as needed while you go, you made need more.

### Step 10: Garnish
Garnish with some salt, or seasoning of your choice.  I sometimes add green onions or furikake seasoning when I am able to.

## Additional Information:
- When using a rice cooker, allow the rice to sit 10 minutes after it is done cooking to reduce any extra moisture.
- This dish can be changed to add vegetables at any point!
