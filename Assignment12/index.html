        <h1 class="centered"> My Journey Journal</h1>
        <p> This website is intended to be used to document my journey with chronic illness as a young adult, and share resources to help other young adults struggling with the same.  Disabilities and conditions are a lot to learn for anyone regardless of your ability to understand, a personal account can help make understanding the impact on young lives easier.</p>

        <h3 class="merriweather-1">About The Author</h3>
        <div class="story-content">
        <p class="storyparagraph"> My name is Anabel Assante. I am a 23-year-old college student currently enrolled at the University of Montana.  I am in my fourth year of college and studying to become a Media Arts major with a focus on film studies.  I have always loved film since I was old enough to remember.  I used to beg for movie nights from my parents and looked forward to each one.  What has enamored me about film for so long was the ability film had to make the viewer feel emotions so strongly.  To project something onto a screen and have an audience experience those emotions as if they were there is what inspired me to choose this major.  My goal for the future is to create a film that allows an audience to experience a deeper understanding, but also feel like they are in the scene of the movie themselves.  I want to recreate those special moments I’ve had for other people and ignite their love for the creative.</p>
    <p class="storyparagraph">This path has not been easy for me, and it continues to be a challenge.  During my first year of college, I had a lot on my plate.  My dad had passed away right before my senior year, when I had been helping take care of him during his chemo for 22 months prior.  COVID hit halfway through my senior year in high school, but it did not affect me as much since I’d been masking up for a year before for my immunocompromised dad.  After my first month in college, I began to experience more pain than normal and extreme fatigue.  My heart didn’t feel right, and I found myself getting winded by simply standing up.  I was already well aware of POTS since my brother had been diagnosed with it in 2015.  I recognized the symptoms immediately and barely made it through my first year of college.  Regardless of my knowledge of what I had from experience, when I went home to be tested, they refused to acknowledge my concerns.  I saw specialist after specialist, doctor after doctor, and traveled constantly over the summer.  All my tests came back in a normal range and time and time again I was left dismissed.  I transferred to a remote program here at the University of Montana since I could not return to a campus.  It took until after my second year of college to be diagnosed with POTS, but my journey wasn’t over there. </p> 
    <p class="storyparagraph">My chronic pain and other symptoms could not be attributed to POTS.  I was well aware of the comorbidities and was familiar with hEDS and HSD beforehand.  A lot of my unexplainable symptoms, like my vocal fatigue and stretch marks, regardless of my size attributed to that.  I knew something was wrong as my physical condition worsened.  I continued my third year of college until the spring semester, when I had an extreme cardiac event.  I was sent to the ER because of a suspected minor heart attack and had to drop out of school as my health spiraled.  I was gone for one semester before returning for my fourth year during the winter semester.  During all of this, I was seeing doctors and dealing with excruciating pain.  There was more than ever, and while I did pass my winter semester with a 4.0, it wasn’t easy, and I required a lot of accommodations.  Then, over winter break, I finally got an HSD diagnosis.  I could not see all the specialists to confirm a case of hEDS, and due to the doctor’s lack of experience with it, they wanted to wait.  Since starting the spring semester, I have been pretty bad and unable to even draw for over 10 minutes due to the state of my joints.  While I am working to improve, my disability affects every part of my life.</p>
    <p class="storyparagraph">I am currently learning to heal and find peace within myself for being disabled so young, but in the world today, it is not easy.  I hope documenting my journey helps another young disabled person, or old, find peace with themselves and learn to live with less shame or guilt.
