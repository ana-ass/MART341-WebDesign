# Worked on journal.html

## 6 Required Techniques:
- Margin: The margin was used all over my style document to help with aesthetics.  I found a way to change my footer margin which allowed me to have the footer go right to the border of the page border.  Before there was a space, and I found a way around that without ruining the inner text margin.  Margin was also used a lot in the drop-down menu again to help with the different pages.
- Padding: Padding helped me with my webpage and the space between text.  In this assignment I used it mostly for my drop down menu in order to keep it from colliding with other elements and causing issues.  
- Border: Used for my images, I adjusted some settings to make the border darker transparency wise.  I also added a border to the entire webpage, and kept it the color from Assignment 10.  I liked how it contrasted, and did not want to change the transparency of it. 
- Dropdown: Applied to my journal entries.  I realized listing every single link out would get hard to manage with the more journal entries I included.  I added a dropdown to acess journal pages easier from the top, so there would be less clutter in the future.
- Display in-line block: Used for the drop down menu.  Tried adding it to my header and footer, but did not like how it looked.
- Position: used to help with the drop down menu, allowed drop down to stay in place instead of moving when clicked on or hovered over.
