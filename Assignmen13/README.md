Responsive Design – I used responsive design for the media in my gallery tab.  I noticed the iframe youtube video did not like to be resized, and by changing it to be responsive it fixed this problem.  It now runs smoothly with a bigger or even a smaller screen.

Media Queries – I added hte media quaries to automatically adjust items based on the browser window.  Most of my items were small and I had limited decoration in order to make it user and mobile friendly, so I did not need my widths to be adjusted too much.

Navigation Menu – The navgation menu I used is my footer and my header.  I already had the footer Navigation Menu established, and chose not to add it to the header.  It caused a gap and changed the aesthetics completely, and so I kept the navigation in the header how it originally was.

Dropdown Menu – The dropdrown Menu is in my journal page.  I completely removed the previous selector which displayed each number individually, and instead kept the drop down instead.  This makes everything look neater and more polished, also shortening the size of the header.
