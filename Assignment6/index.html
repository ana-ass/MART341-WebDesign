        <h2>Why am I making a Journey Journal?</h2>
        <p>I am making a journey journal to not only share my story but to provide resources for other disabled folks, or people who wish to learn more about chronic illnesses.  Disabilities and conditions are a lot to learn for anyone regardless of your ability to understand, a personal account can help make understanding the impact on young lives easier.</p>
