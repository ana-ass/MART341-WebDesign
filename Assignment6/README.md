The website I chose to expand on was a personal journal to document my journey with chronic health problems and reclaiming my life from it.  I believe this option would be a good starting point, and give me something to look forward to completing.

While working on this code, I cycled through a lot of widths and background colors.  I had many color schemes that I tried and cycled through when it came to my styles.  A dark color made it too hard to see text, but the lighter colors were too harsh on the eyes.  I found a nice balance with the beige and gray, it was not visually distracting and had a comforting level of saturation.  This process was very time consuming since I had 15 different combinations planned out, and ended up not using any of them for the final result.  The final design is rough compared to my initial idea, but as I hone my skills with the futhering weeks I hope to polish up the aesthetic of the site.

I am doing ok, the intense typing is a struggle but I am working on getting proper bracing in order to keep this under control.  I believe now that I have started the website, the following assignments will get easier because I have the fundemental building blocks down.  I greatly appreciate patience in this process, and the ability given to me to create a website that has been my goal since the start of this year.
