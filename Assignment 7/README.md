The aspect of my website that I am most proud of is the Resource and Contact Form.  It is a simple form and table, but hopefully as the code continues I will be able to expand on the resources I can provide.  I hoped to make the form as thorough as possible for users, so they can provide alternate forms of contact while also asking me questions about possible resources for themselves or a loved one.  This website is meant to be educational to the disabled and the able-bodied, and I am proud that this coding gives me the capabilities to provide answers to possible questions.

Things are going ok right now, I am still working hard on catching up and enjoying the aspects of what we are learning.  I hope to improve the aesthetics of the page the further the course goes along.
