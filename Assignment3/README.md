# Assignment 3

## Topic: What are you particularly eager to learn this semester?

What I am most eager to learn this semester is how to condense my **Style Classes** in the *CSS* coding language.  The ability to condense and streamline my code will make my hobby coding much faster, and will allow me to code more custom profiles for my friends.  The goal is to take commissions for these CSS profiles, and hopefully I will gain the ability to do that from this class.

**The themes I have in mind for future profile projects:**
- Mudkip (Pokemon)
- Space (likely moon or galaxy themed)
- Aquarium 

A place you can find one of my custom profiles is on my [Pokefarm Accout](https://pokefarm.com/user/Peeps).  An image will be attached *below*.
