Div: I used <div> elements in order to group my media and resource tabs.  This helps organize where my media that I post and collect myself, between medical and professional imagery that can help with navigating resources.

Span: I used <span> elements to organize my text and images.  This helped me group information or media that went together, and easily organize them onto my page.

Audio: The audio element is a future background, fair use track that I would like to add to my journal posts.  Some people enjoy background sounds while they are reading, especially if the music fits the energy of the post.  I would love to add more audio as time goes on so I have a track to fit each mood.

Video:  The video element I included was a video of 180bpm metronome.  This is a video I will use in one of my journal entries to give an auditory display of how fast my heart beats when I walk.  Videos will help with understanding what I experience as a disabled person, as most of my symptoms are "invisible".

Iframe:  I used the iframe element to embed my video into my website.  This iframe command was very helpful in linking a working youtube video that can be enjoyed from the browser without needing to visit the domain.

Class: The classes in my assignment helped me to format text faster in my writing.  All of my descriptions were kept tidy and I could format any text without needing to by hand later down the line.  I am looking forward to utilizing class more with my journal entries.

Escape character: The escape character I used was the Ampersand.  It is a visual way to communicate "and", and allows for less space being taken when their are smaller descriptions.  It is a great way to conserve space in the smaller webpages I may have.
