        <p class="para">Welcome to my <b>FIRST</b> journal entry!  I chose to write this entry while working on this assignment for the website.  The date of writing this entry is 4/18/2025, my late father's birthday.</p>
        <p class="para">I woke up in a flare-up today, unable to get out of bed for the first couple hours of my day.  I chose to finish watching the apartment blocks around me wake up, since it was 7:00 am when my alarm went off.  It was peaceful at first, and I did stretches as I could while my cat continued to sleep.  Come 9:00 am, she woke up and demanded her breakfast reminding me of the routine I couldn't ignore.  I had to grab my rollator in the mean time where I could sit on the seat and slowly push it around with my feet.  It is a very time-consuming solution but was my only option since my wheelchair has yet to be approved.</p>
        <p class="para">After feeding my cat, I had to figure out my own breakfast.  With the coffee beginning to brew, I decided to make my favorite rice and eggs.  It is a very low effort meal but allows for me to get sodium and protein which is important.  I am still trying to figure out how to cook while seated, as it takes a lot more awareness to navigate the kitchen and cookspace in front of me.  Even if it took me extra time, the meal was delicious and I will share my recipe below!  I am still trying to find more accessible ways to cook for myself and others.  I have spent the rest of the day planning out my week and organizing my To-Do List.  My main goal is to end the semester with no missing assignments, and so I am trying to organize my priorities to make this easier to achieve.  On that note, it's time to get started on completing these assignments!  Here's to a successful semester regardless of my own struggles.</p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 1: Prepare Your Rice</h4>
        <img src="./images/rice1.jpg" alt="Rice in a Square Container" class="img">
        <p>First, pour out one cup of rice into a bowl or your rice cooker.
        <br>
        <br> 

        Wash the rice by stirring your hand in the grains and drain. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Repeat process until water is not milky.</p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 2: Cook Your Rice</h4>
        <img src="./images/ricecooker.jpg" alt="Rice in a Rice Cooker" class="img">
        <p>Allow your rice to cook, if it is in a rice cooker it will take around 15-20 minutes.
            <br>
            <br> 
    
            Once the rice is done, let it sit with the lid on and let it continue to stay warm in the pot.
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 3: Start the Eggs</h4>
        <img src="./images/butterpan.jpg" alt="Butter melting in a pan" class="img">
        <p>Take out a pan that has a lid which can fit.
            <br>
            <br> 
    
            Set the heat to medium and oil lightly. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 4: Cook the Eggs</h4>
        <img src="./images/egg.jpg" alt="Eggs in a Carton" class="img">
        <p>Once the pan is up to the proper heat, crack <b>two</b> eggs into the pan.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Keep the yolks intact, do not let them break.
            <br>
            <br>
            Season with salt, pepper, or seasonings of choice.
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 5: Steam the Eggs</h4>
        <img src="./images/eggpancook.jpg" alt="Three Eggs cooking in Pan with cooked egg whites" class="img">
        <p>Once the whites of the eggs have started to solidify, add a small amount of water into the pan.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Cover with the lid immediately to start steam cooking the eggs.
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 6: Plate your Rice</h4>
        <img src="./images/ricebowl.jpg" alt="Rice plated in a Bowl" class="img">
        <p>Place your rice into a bowl or onto a plate and flatten, season if you would like at this step.
            <br>
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 7: Remove the Eggs</h4>
        <img src="./images/friedegg.jpg" alt="Cooked Egg in a Pan" class="img">
        <p>After cooking until the egg is steamed, and the yolk has ample movement (around 2-3 minutes) remove the lid and take the pan off the heat.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Using a spatula take the eggs out of the pan, and place them onto the rice.
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 8: Dress the Dish</h4>
        <img src="./images/soysauce.jpg" alt="Soy Sauce in a Bowl" class="img">
        <p>Take soy sauce and add to your own personal taste.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once it is applied to your liking, add toasted sesame oil to your own preference.
            <br>
            <br>
            I personally use a lot due to the need of high sodium, but this recipe will not change based on the amount.
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 9: Stir</h4>
        <img src="./images/chopstickegg.jpg" alt="chopsticks in a bowl of eggs, rice, and vegetables" class="img">
        <p>Using Chopsticks or a Fork, depending on your choice stir your dish.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Use long strokes in order to properly break up the eggs and allow the yolk to bind the rice together.
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Step 10: Garnish &amp; Enjoy</h4>
        <img src="./images/greenonion.jpg" alt="Chopped Green Onions on a Cutting Board" class="img">
        <p>Garnish with some salt, or seasoning of your choice.
            <br>
            <br> 
            I sometimes add green onions or furikake seasoning when I am able to.
            <br>
            <br>
            Enjoy!
        </p>

        <h4 class="centered">Additional Tips</h4>
        <ol>
            <li class="stylelist">When using a rice cooker, allow the rice to sit 10 minutes after it is done cooking to reduce any extra moisture.</li>
            <li class="stylelist">This dish can be changed to add vegetables at any point!</li>
        </ol>
